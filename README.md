# Face Recognition with OpenCV and kNN

## Introduction
This face recognition project leverages the power of Python, OpenCV, and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to identify faces in images or video streams. The goal is to provide a simple yet effective solution for facial recognition tasks.

## Key Features
- **OpenCV Integration:** Utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks, including face detection and image processing.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm:** Implements the kNN algorithm for facial recognition, a machine learning technique that classifies faces based on their proximity to known examples.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers an intuitive interface for users to easily interact with the face recognition system.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for developing the face recognition system.
- **OpenCV:** A powerful open-source computer vision library used for face detection and image manipulation.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** A machine learning algorithm employed for face recognition.
